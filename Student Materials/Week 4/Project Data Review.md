# Cognitive Hackathon: Week 4
## Project Data Review

## Overview
Students discuss data topics in regards to their projects.

## Group Review (60 mins)
In light of yesterday's discussion about data and its interpretation, think about and discuss these topics with the class:

	• What were some of the gaps in our data?
    • What did we learn from our project analysis?
	• What were some of our incorrect assumptions?
	• What might be some ethical implications of our project?
	• What did we learn about our project?

You can add to your Azure Notebook with these newfound concerns around data analysis ethics.

## Summary
We developed an increased understanding of the role of data in our projects.
