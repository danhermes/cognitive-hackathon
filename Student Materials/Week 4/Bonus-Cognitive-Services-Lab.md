# Cognitive Hackathon: Week 4
## Bonus Cognitive Services

## Overview
Hack some extra cognitive services.

## Objectives
Activate more API keys for services you didn't try before.

## Prerequisites
Completed Computer Vision and Text Analytics Labs.

## Exercises
This hands-on lab includes the following exercises:
* Exercise 1: Demo cognitive services
* Exercise 2: Try some cognitive services

### Exercise 1: Demo cognitive services
 There are quite a few cognitive services that you haven't worked with in this course. 

    https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/directory/

You can do an online demo these APIs using the "Demo" link next to the APIs. Demo as many as you want.

Once you go to that link, see the tabs up top for our Azure Cognitive Services:

* Vision
* Speech
* Language
* Anomaly Detection
* Search

Each of these tabs contains a group of cognitive APIs:

### Vision
Extract information from images to categorize and process visual data. Perform machine-assisted moderation of images to help curate your services.
* Computer Vision
* Video Indexer
* Face 
* Custom Vision
* Content Moderator

### Speech
Translate between speech, text, and other languages as well as identify speakers.

After you've demoed enough services, you can go ahead and work with the 

### Exercise 2: Try some cognitive services
If you wish to work with code, by clicking "Try for free", you can choose the free 7-day licenses for all of these services and experiment with them on your own.

Note: If any of your licenses have expired, you cannot use any of the services on the same tab (Vision, Speech, etc.)

## Summary
We've worked with just a few final cognitive services to wrap up this course.
