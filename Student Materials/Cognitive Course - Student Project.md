# Cognitive Hackathon: Project

## Summary
How would you change the world using cognitive computing? Think of a real-world application of the concepts we've covered. Imagine a design that will harness computer vision or text analytics to achieve a goal, help people, make money, advance science, entertain, heal, or inspire. Build a simple, working prototype of that idea.

## Your Mission

The world is changing, with machines helping humans to make more and more of our key decisions. Cognitive computing helps us to drive, walk, and fly where we want to go. It helps engineers to build cars, architects to design buildings, and even teachers to guide their students to safety during disasters. Entire cities and even countries are being governed and surveilled using databases of data collected on citizens, camera feeds at every streetcorner, and troves of social media and email flowing unsecured through the internet. Soldiers are fighting wars with enhanced views of their adversaries and the battlefield, and robotic warfighting machines are making more and more decisions about who they should target. Cognitive systems are helping doctors save patients, deliver babies, and cure cancer.

Knowing what you've learned about what cognitive systems can do, focus upon the capabilities of computer vision and text analytics to create an idea of your own. Choose whichever direction, value, industry, goal, or result that you would like to pursue. Make it something personal to you, something that you care about or that you find interesting. You can be an entrepreneur, be social-minded, discover something, or change the way people think. It's up to you.

Example: Using public images from Instagram, a new technology could couple geolocation and images run through cognitive services to identify which cities prefer dogs to cats and which prefer cats to dogs. The social good aspect could be to help animals find homes faster by moving cats to cities that prefer cats and dogs to cities that prefer dogs.

Once you've picked your idea, give thought to the following high level considerations:
* What is my idea? 
* What inspired my idea?
* Who would benefit from this idea? How?
* How would I build this idea?
* What are some challenges?
* Who has done something similar? Did they succeed? How?


Now that you have a high level concept, let's get into the detail in your application:

* What cognitive API will I use?
* Where would the data come from? (even if it needs to be imaginary or simulated)
* What will the data look like?
* What will be the UI design of my app? (even if I need to simplify for this prototype)
* What will be the architecture of my app? What classes will I need?
* How exactly will I use the Azure Cognitive API to make this happen?
* How will I measure success in testing?

You should have a vivid picture of what you want to build. Now, using Python in the Azure Notebook environment with the Azure Cognitive API:

Let's build it.
