# Cognitive Hackathon: Week 1 - Teacher's Guide
## Day 3

## Overview
Explore Python witnin the Azure Notebooks environment.

## Objectives
Day three involves wrapping up the Azure Notebook Lab and lesson, then delving into the Python language, exploring its use in Azure Notebooks, basic syntax, and code examples. This day will orient the students that they may strike out on their own with Python, experimenting with the language while they build their own Notebooks.


## Student Lab: Azure Notebooks Lab

Students will complete the lab from the previous day, which includes these activities:

* Create a free Azure Notebooks account
* Create a new Project
* Create a new Notebook
* Notebook Cells
* Code Cells

Next let's explore Python by running snippets of code in Azure Notebook Code Cells.

## Teacher Demo: Introduction to Python
Walk through Python code examples using the following Azure Notebook:
[Introduction to Python]("https://github.com/danhermes/cognitive-hackathon/Teacher%Guide/Week%1/Introduction%to%Python.ipynb").

That notebook introduces these Python topics:
* Comments
* Data Types
* Lists
* Control Flow Tools
* Functions
* Classes
* Errors and Exceptions

Once your demo is completed, it's the students' turn.

## Student Lab: Introduction to Python
The students should now walk through the Intro to Python lab using the same notebook.
[Introduction to Python]("https://github.com/danhermes/cognitive-hackathon/Teacher%Guide/Week%1/Introduction%to%Python.ipynb").

## Summary
This class introduced the fundamentals of Python.
