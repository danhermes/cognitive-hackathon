# Cognitive Computing Hackathon: Week 1 - Teacher's Guide
## Day 3

Day three involves wrapping up the Azure Notebook Lab and lesson, then delving into the Python language, exploring its use in Azure Notebooks, basic syntax, and code examples. This day will orient the students sufficiently that they may strike out on their own, experimenting with the language while they build their own Notebooks.
