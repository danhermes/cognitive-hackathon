# Cognitive Hackathon: Week 1 - Teacher's Guide
## Day 2

Azure Notebooks is the next topic. Get your students hands-on with the coding environment they'll be using for this course: Azure Notebooks. This online implementation of the open source development environment called Jupyter lets the student create projects in Python, debug, and run them without downloading any software: cloud-based software development. The lab will include the creation of a project and files, editing of markdown, and running of code.


## Azure Notebooks Intro

Open source delvelopment requires a place to work, a code editor that lets you run and debug your apps. Jupyter is a popular editor and we'll be using it, but not the usual way, downloaded onto your PC. We'll use it in the cloud, with Azure Notebooks. Azure Notebooks combines Jupyter with a project organizer that lets you create, edit, and maintain all your projects and files. We'll be using this workstation in the cloud.

Now let's take a look at it:

Next we'll walk through the basics of Azure Notebooks:

* Create a free Azure Notebooks account
* Create a new Project
* Create a new file
* Edit Markdown
* Write code
* Run Code

Let's begin with creating a free account:

### Create a Free Azure Notebooks account

Open your browser and head to https://notebooks.azure.com/.

Click on "Try It Now" to navigate to Microsoft Azure Notebooks Projects page.

In the upper right-hand corner, click the "Sign In" link, which brings us to the Microsoft login. Use your existing login or "Create one!". This brings you back to the Projects page and you're logged in.

Click on the My Projects link at the top left.

You'll now be looking at your project list titled "My Projects", which should be empty.

Note the three greyed-out links, Run, Download and Delete. We'll get to those later.

In the upper-right are Search Projects, Terminal, New Project, and Upload GitHub Repo.

Now let's create our first project:

### Create a new Project

Click on the New Project button in the upper right. This gives you a popup where you can set up your new project.

Give your project a name and an id, a string used for sharing your project. If you want the project to be private then uncheck Public. Click create and your new project will be created.

Within a project, you can create any number of things using the "+" button on the right.
