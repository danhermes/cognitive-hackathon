# Cognitive Computing Hackathon: Week 1 - Teacher's Guide
## Day 4

Day four is about completing the Python labs, with students becoming familiar with the IDE and language used throughout this class. End the week with a quick code walkthrough of the Computer Vision API and an explanation of the class project. Finally the instructor should get students thinking about ways that they could use cognitive computing and make mention of the course project.


## Complete Python Lab

Allow the students over half the class period to work in Python. This skill is critical to success in this course. These are the tasks in the Python Lab:

* Basic examples to introduce the language
* Simple lab

After the students have completed their Python Lab, conduct a quick code review of Cognitive API.

## Cognitive API - Code Walkthroughs

Computer Vision and Text Analysis

This will will also include an introduction to the Azure Cognitive Services API. Students should use this as a guide to figuring out their idea, knowing that they will have to choose one or more to focus on in the next week.


## Course Project

The student project for the course is central to this curriculum and everything covered in Week 1 leads up to the project that begins in Week 2.  Here is the project high-level requirement: 

How would you change the world using cognitive computing? Think of a real-world application of the concepts we've covered. Imagine a design that will harness computer vision or text analytics to achieve a goal, help people, make money, advance science, entertain, heal, or inspire. Build a simple, working prototype of that idea.
