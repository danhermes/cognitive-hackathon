# Cognitive Hackathon: Week 1 - Teacher's Guide
## Day 4

Day four is about completing the Python labs, with students becoming familiar with the IDE and language used throughout this class. Get the students thinking about ways that they could use cognitive computing and make mention of the course project.


## Complete Python Lab

Allow the students to complete their Python Lab and spend some time experimenting with the language. See Azure Notebook: [Introduction to Python]("https://notebooks.azure.com/dan-bcwqcg/projects/teals-cogserv-examples"). This skill is critical to success in this course. These are the tasks in the Python Lab:

* Comments
* Data Types
* Lists
* Control Flow Tools
* Functions
* Classes
* Errors and Exceptions

Introduce the fulcrum of this course: the student project.

## Student Project

The student project for the course is central to this curriculum and everything covered in Week 1 leads up to the project that begins in Week 2.  Here is the project high-level requirement: 

How would you change the world using cognitive computing? Think of a real-world application of the concepts we've covered. Imagine a design that will harness computer vision or text analytics to achieve a goal, help people, make money, advance science, entertain, heal, or inspire. Build a simple, working prototype of that idea.

## BONUS

## Compute tier
The Run drop-down list on the project dashboard is where you select the compute tier on which the project runs. By default, projects run on the Free Compute tier, which is limited to 4GB of memory and 1GB of data to prevent abuse:
