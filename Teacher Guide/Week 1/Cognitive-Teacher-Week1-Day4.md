# Cognitive Hackathon: Week 1 - Teacher's Guide
## Day 4

## Overview
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now a commonly used term. This class will explore AI in the context of cognitive computing. The student project for this course will be introduced.

## Objectives
Today there are a few goals:
* Students complete the Python labs, with students becoming familiar with the Notebook IDE and Python language used throughout this class. 
* Explain Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the context of cognitive computing. Show real-world examples of AI. Get the students thinking about ways that they could use cognitive computing. 
* Make mention of the course project.

## Student Lab: Introduction to Python (15 mins)

Allow the students to complete their Python Lab and spend some time experimenting with the language. See Azure Notebook: [Introduction to Python]("https://notebooks.azure.com/dan-bcwqcg/projects/teals-cogserv-examples"). This skill is critical to success in this course. These are the tasks in the Python Lab:

* Comments
* Data Types
* Lists
* Control Flow Tools
* Functions
* Classes
* Errors and Exceptions


## Teacher Presentation: Real World AI (40 mins)

Introduce the concept of AI and provide real-world examples. Present directly from the notebook called *Real-world-AI* in the *Azure Notebooks* folder with a project called *TEALS Cognitive Services Examples*. 



Introduce the fulcrum of this course: the student project.

## Teacher Explains: Student Project (5 mins)

The student project for the course is central to this curriculum and everything covered in Week 1 leads up to the project that begins in Week 2.  Here is the project high-level requirement: 

How would you change the world using cognitive computing? Think of a real-world application of the concepts we've introduced. Imagine a design that will harness computer vision or text analytics to achieve a goal, help people, make money, advance science, entertain, heal, or inspire. Build a simple, working prototype of that idea.

(Don't hand the project out until next week. Today is just a teaser.)

## Summary
This class covered Artificial Intelligence (AI) and some real-world examples. The crux of the student course project was introduced.
