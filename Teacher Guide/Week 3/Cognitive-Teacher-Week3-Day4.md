# Cognitive Hackathon: Week 3 - Teacher's Guide
## Day 4

## Overview
Project summaries are created for presentation.

## Objectives
Students complete the development of their project. They then create a summary of their project, including data inputs and JSON outputs and interpretation, as well as their conclusions. This will be presented to the class first thing next week.

## Teacher Instructions: Project Summaries (60 mins)
(This exercise is in the students' Week 3 folder on their Project Conclusions sheet.)
Students will work in their teams to summaries their results and conclusions from their project. These results should go into their notebooks to use for presentations next week. Summaries should answer these questions:

### Project Goals
What is the goal of the project?
Who would benefit from this idea? How?
What are the challenges?

### Cognitive Services
How will cognitive services help make the project a reality?
Are the provided cognitive services sufficient to meet the projects requirements? If so then how? In not then what more is needed?
What are the important aspects of the cognitive analysis that must work in order for the project to succeed?
What are some of the risks in using cognitive services for this project?

### Data Sets
What data sets (images, text) would be necessary to make this project a success?
What will be the sources of that data and how will it be gathered?

### Project Output and Result
What are the outputs of this project? Decisions, analysis, data, etc.
Who will use this output? How?
What would constitute useful output?

### Conclusions
What were the successes in this project? What were the challenges?
What would be the best case scenario for the success of this project? How would it affect the world?

### New Directions
What were some of the best ideas that came up for other projects?
Would those also use cognitive services or something else?

## Summary
Students created project summaries for presentation in the next class.
