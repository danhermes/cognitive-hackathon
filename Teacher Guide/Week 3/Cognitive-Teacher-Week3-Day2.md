# Cognitive Hackathon: Week 3 - Teacher's Guide
## Day 2

Students complete their vision and text labs from yesterday. Afterwards, it's time for students to get hands-on with code and markdown to develop their project concept. Again, copy and paste of API calls is acceptable. Focus needs to be on the concept and on useful data.


## Implement Project: Day 1

Using the Computer Vision or Text Analytics cognitive service and Python with Zure Notebooks, students explore their project concept. This is best thought of as Research and Development(R&D) project as teams will not be expected to produce a working app or prototype for the project. The goal is for students to learn about these topics and experiences. 

Students will have two days/classes to implement their project and on the last day of this week will formulate project conclusions.

## Other Cognitive Services
Ambitious students and teams may wish to explore other cognitive services besides Computer Vision and Text Analytics. This course is scoped at vision and text but that doesn't prevent teams from trying other services, such as Face or Translator Text. This would require that they learn APIs not presented in class, possibly requiring you to teach additional material of your own making or supporting development without providing proper background. The scope of cognitive services used by the teams on this project is entirely up to you. You are bounded only by your own time constraints and your students' imagination.
