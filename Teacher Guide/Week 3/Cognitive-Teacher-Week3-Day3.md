# Cognitive Hackathon: Week 3 - Teacher's Guide
## Day 4

Students continue developing their concept.

## Implement Project: Day 2

Using the Computer Vision or Text Analytics cognitive service and Python with Azure Notebooks, students further explore their project concept. Teams will not be expected to produce a working app or prototype for the project. The goal is for students to learn about these topics and experiences. 

Today is the students' last whole class period to implement their project. Next calls, they will wrap up the project and formulate project conclusions.

## Guidance

Teams may require guidance. This could be in the form of help with cognitive APIs or the project topics. Here are some suggestions:

In forming requirements for the project, ask these questions: 

* What is the goal of the project? Who would benefit from this idea? How?

Incorporation of cognitive services may require answering questions like: 

* What are the important aspects of the cognitive analysis that must work in order for the project to succeed?

Devising input requirements for the project necessitates answering this question:

* What data sets (images, text) would be necessary to make this project a success?

Knowing how the project will produce results requires an answer to:

* What are the outputs of this project? Decisions, analysis, data, etc.

Measuring the success of the project:

* What would be the best case scenario for the success of this project? How would it affect the world?


## Other Cognitive Services
Ambitious students and teams may wish to explore other cognitive services besides Computer Vision and Text Analytics. The scope of cognitive services used by the teams on this project is entirely up to you.
