# Cognitive Hackathon: Week 3 - Teacher's Guide
## Day 4

Students continue developing their concept.

## Implement Project: Day 2

Using the Computer Vision or Text Analytics cognitive service and Python with Zure Notebooks, students further explore their project concept. Teams will not be expected to produce a working app or prototype for the project. The goal is for students to learn about these topics and experiences. 

Today is the students' last whole class period to implement their project. Next calls, they will wrap up the project and formulate project conclusions.

## Additional Guidance

Teams may require individual guidance. This could be in the form of help with cognitive APIs or the project topics. Here are some additional suggestions:

In forming requirements for the project, ask these questions: 

In the execution and implementation of this idea:
* What will be some of the challenges?

After the vision and text cognitive services functionalities are considered:
* Are the these cognitive services sufficient to meet the projects requirements? If so then how? In not then what more is needed?
* What are some of the risks in using cognitive services for this project?

In consideration of the input data sets:
* Where will the data come from? What will be the sources of that data and how will it be gathered?

Regarding project output:
* Who will use this output? How?
* What would constitute useful output?

Shooting as high as possible and being completely optimistic:
* What would be the best case scenario for the success of this project? How would it affect the world?


## Other Cognitive Services
Ambitious students and teams may wish to explore other cognitive services besides Computer Vision and Text Analytics. The scope of cognitive services used by the teams on this project is entirely up to you.
