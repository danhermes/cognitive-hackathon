# Cognitive Hackathon: Week 3 - Teacher's Guide
## Day 1

## Overview
Cognitive services code walkthrough of computer vision and text analytics examples and accompanying labs.

## Objectives
Today is a hands-on code day where you walk through the Computer Vision and Text Analytics code examples. Help them to understand these services well enough to use them in their own prototypes. It's OK to have students copy code into their Azure Notebook, rather than fully understand the Python HTTP requests, but they should have some instruction around what the code is doing and why. Students work on the Computer Vision Lab and Text Analytics Lab. 

## Teacher Instruction: Cognitive Services Code Walkthroughs
Soon your teams will begin coding on this project. Before you do that let's look at how these cognitive services are called, close up:

### Teacher Demo: Text Analysis Code Walkthrough (10 mins)
As before, we'll begin with Text Analysis, but this time you'll discuss every line of code, as the class already understands the basic functionality. Use the same notebook called *cogservices_textanalytics* in the Azure Notebooks folder with a project called *TEALS Cognitive Services Examples*. 

Walk through the code, demonstrating setup and execution of text analysis cognitive API calls. Talk about how we might parse the JSON.

### Teacher Demo: Computer Vision Code Walkthrough (10 mins)
Next we'll look at a Computer Vision example, also a quick runthrough to inspire students to be thinking about the capability. In the same TEALS project there's a notebook called *cogservices_vision*. 

Walk through the code, with special focus the steps needed to call and API and return a result. 

## Student Lab: Text Analytics (20 mins)
Students do the Text Analytics lab. Use the same notebook called *cogservices_textanalytics* in the Azure Notebooks folder with a project called *TEALS Cognitive Services Examples*. 

## Student Lab: Computer Vision (20 mins)
Students do the Computer Vision lab. In the same TEALS project there's a notebook called *cogservices_vision*. 

## Summary
In this class, students learned how to use text analytics and computer vision cognitive services.
