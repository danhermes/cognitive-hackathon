# Cognitive Hackathon: Week 1 - Teacher's Guide
## Day 1

Today is a hands-on code day where you walk through the Computer Vision and Text Analytics code examples. Help them to understand these services well enough to use them in their own prototypes. It's OK to have students copy code into their Azure Notebook, rather than fully understand the Python HTTP requests, but they should have some instruction around what the code is doing and why. Students work on the Computer Vision Lab and Text Analytics Lab.

BONUS

Students call the Azure Cognitive Services API and get the JSON output for the data set that they were interested in. This is not meant to be the course project, but rather to use some images that they might have in their data set and see what kind of information is returned via the JSON object using the API calls.
