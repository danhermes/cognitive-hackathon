# Cognitive Hackathon: Week 3 - Teacher's Guide
## Day 1

Today is a hands-on code day where you walk through the Computer Vision and Text Analytics code examples. Help them to understand these services well enough to use them in their own prototypes. It's OK to have students copy code into their Azure Notebook, rather than fully understand the Python HTTP requests, but they should have some instruction around what the code is doing and why. Students work on the Computer Vision Lab and Text Analytics Lab. 

## Cognitive Services Code Walkthrough
Soon your teams will begin coding on this project. Before you do that let's look at how these cognitive services are called, close up:

### Text Analysis Code Walkthrough
As before, we'll begin with Text Analysis, but this time you'll discuss every line of code, as the class already understands the basic functionality. Use the same notebook called cogservices_textanalytics in the Azure Notebooks folder with a project called TEALS Cognitive Services Examples. Walk through the code, demonstrating setup and execution of text analysis cognitive API calls. Talk about how we might parse the JSON.

### Computer Vision Code Walkthrough
 Next we'll look at a Computer Vision example, also a quick runthrough to inspire students to be thinking about the capability. In the same TEALS project there's a notebook called cogservices_vision. Walk through the code, with special focus the steps needed to call and API and return a result.

## Cognitive Computing Labs
Students are hands on with two labs: Computer Vision and Text Analytics.



## BONUS

Students call the Azure Cognitive Services API and get the JSON output for the data set that they were interested in. This is not meant to be the course project, but rather to use some images that they might have in their data set and see what kind of information is returned via the JSON object using the API calls.
