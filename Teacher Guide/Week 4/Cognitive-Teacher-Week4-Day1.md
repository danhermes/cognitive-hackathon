# Cognitive Hackathon: Week 4 - Teacher's Guide
## Day 1

## Overview
Each team will present their project's findings and conclusions. 

## Objectives
Students will learn about the goals, approaches, and implementations of all of the team projects. Project data and output will be explained along with project conclusions.

## Teacher Instruction: Presentations (60 mins)
(This exercise is in the students' Week 3 folder on their Project Conclusions sheet.)
Call upon each team in turn to share their conclusions arrived at last week. Encourage class discussion about the projects. This presentation and discussion may continue into the next class. The teams will address these topics:

* Project Goals
* Cognitive Services
* Data Sets
* Project Output and Result
* Conclusions
* New Directions

These are detailed descriptions of the suggested topics in their project conclusions:

### Project Goals
What is the goal of the project?
Who would benefit from this idea? How?
What are the challenges?

### Cognitive Services
How will cognitive services help make the project a reality?
Are the provided cognitive services sufficient to meet the projects requirements? If so then how? In not then what more is needed?
What are the important aspects of the cognitive analysis that must work in order for the project to succeed?
What are some of the risks in using cognitive services for this project?

### Data Sets
What data sets (images, text) would be necessary to make this project a success?
What will be the sources of that data and how will it be gathered?

### Project Output and Result
What are the outputs of this project? Decisions, analysis, data, etc.
Who will use this output? How?
What would constitute useful output?

### Conclusions
What were the successes in this project? What were the challenges?
What would be the best case scenario for the success of this project? How would it affect the world?

### New Directions
What were some of the best ideas that came up for other projects?
Would those also use cognitive services or something else?

## Summary
Students shared their project conclusions and learned the results of all of the other team projects.
