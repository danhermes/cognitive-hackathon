# Cognitive Hackathon: Week 4 - Teacher's Guide
## Day 2

Complete the project presentations. Talk over the next two days about data, what it is, where it comes from, how we try to interpret it, and its challenges.


## Complete Presentations
Conclusions arrived at last week will be presented by each team in turn. Encourage class discussion about the projects. The teams will address these topics:

* Project Goals
* Cognitive Services
* Data Sets
* Project Output and Result
* Conclusions
* New Directions

## Data Presentation

Cognitive systems only work if the data they are given is good. Talk a bit about the responsibility we then have to ensure that data sets are complete. Sometimes we get results that we know to be incomplete and there are causes for this. Both we and cognitive systems can draw incorrect assumptions, interpreting data in ways that do not reflect reality. Talk about why that is. Lastly, as our systems are capable of digesting and interpreting more and more data, we are faced with moral decisions. Discuss the ethical implications of cognitive systems. 

### Incomplete Input 
Unreliable results in an application are often due to incomplete input. That is, missing data can cause havoc in a analytical system.

### Incorrect Assumptions
