## Day 3

## Overview
Students discuss data topics in regards to their projects.

## Objectives

## Teacher Instruction: Group Review
In light of yesterday's discussion about data and its interpretation, conduct a class discussion on these topics.:

	• What were some of the gaps in our data?
    • What did we learn from our project analysis?
	• What were some of our incorrect assumptions?
	• What might be some ethical implications of our project?
	• What did we learn about our project?

Students can add to their Azure Notebook with these newfound concerns around data analysis ethics.

## Summary
Students developed an increased understanding of the role of data in their projects.
