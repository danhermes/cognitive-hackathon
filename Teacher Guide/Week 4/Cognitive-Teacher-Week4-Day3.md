# Cognitive Hackathon: Week 1 - Teacher's Guide
## Day 4

Day three involves wrapping up the Azure Notebook Lab and lesson, then delving into the Python language, exploring its use in Azure Notebooks, basic syntax, and code examples. This day will orient the students that they may strike out on their own with Python, experimenting with the language while they build their own Notebooks.


## Complete Azure Notebooks Lab

Students need to complete the lab from the previous day, which includes these activities:

* Create a free Azure Notebooks account
* Create a new Project
* Create a new Notebook
* Notebook Cells
* Code Cells

Next let's explore Python by running snippets of code in Azure Notebook Code Cells.
