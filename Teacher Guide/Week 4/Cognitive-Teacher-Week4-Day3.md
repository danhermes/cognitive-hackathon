# Cognitive Hackathon: Week 4 - Teacher's Guide
## Day 3

Conduct a Group Review and discussion around the project data, assumptions, and interpretation.

## Group Review
In light of yesterday's discussion about data and its interpretation, conduct a class discussion on these topics:

	• What were some of the gaps in our data?
    • What did we learn from our project analysis?
	• What were some of our incorrect assumptions?
	• What might be some ethical implications of our project?
	• What did we learn about our project?

Students can add to their Azure Notebook with these new found concerns around data analysis ethics.
