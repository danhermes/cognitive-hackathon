# Cognitive Hackathon: Week 4 - Teacher's Guide
## Day 4

## Overview
Cognitive Hackathon Wrapup with more cognitive service hacking

## Objectives
Students can ask any outstanding questions. They can then activate more API keys for services they didn't try before to try them out just for fun.

## Teacher Instructions: Final Words
Ask the students if they have any further questions or topics for discussion in regards to the project and/or data. Now is the time to wrap up any loose threads from the course.

The rest of the day is really all about hacking for fun:

## Teacher Instructions: Bonus Cognitive Services
Remind the students that there are quite a few more cognitive services that we haven't worked with in this course. Invite them to demo and try as many as they want. Invite them to do the following open-ended lab:

## Student Lab: Bonus Cognitive Services (60 mins)
The complete text for this lab is in the Student/Week 4 folder in Bonus-Cognitive-Services.md. 

There are quite a few more cognitive services that you haven't worked with in this course. Demo them and try as many as you want: 

    https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/directory/

You can do an online demo these APIs using the "Demo" link next to the APIs. 

If you wish to work with code, by clicking "Try for free", you can get free 7-day licenses for all of these services and experiment with them on your own.

The purpose of today is open-ended exploration. It's not a day where code needs to all work. If you get it working, great. If you can review the code, read the doc, and see the API in action in the demo then you're good.

Again, run demos using the *Demo* links and get into the code with *Try It Out* and *Quickstarts*.

## Summary
This class concludes the course and exposes students to more cognitive services.

## End of Course
This course was an overview of some of the most important, cutting-edge technology available today. You now have an idea of what people mean when they say AI and how you can build your own cognitive apps!
