# Cognitive Hackathon: Week 4 - Teacher's Guide
## Day 4

Cognitive Hackathon Wrapup. Students can activate more API keys for services they didn't try before to try them out just for fun.


## Cognitive Computing APIs

There are quite a few more cognitive APIs that we haven't worked with in this course. 

    https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/directory/

You or the students can do an online demo these APIs using the "Demo" link next to the APIs.

If they wish to work with code, by clicking "Try for free", students may can get free 7-day licenses for all of these services and experiment with them on their own for the remainder of the class.
