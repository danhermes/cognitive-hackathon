# Cognitive Computing Hackathon: Week 2 - Teacher's Guide
## Overview

The four hours of this course this week will break down into these sections, which can be done one per day:

**Day 1**  Students brainstorm about cognitive
Students develop concept
	• ideation, technological design, and identifying potential issues. (Think startup pitch
	• Encourage Team - groups of 2-3 students
Demo the API
	• Demo of GitHub
	• Use "Bing Spell Check API v7" as an example API to show them the format for calling the API in Python
	• Don't Start other TRIALS YET!!!

Demo JSON Parsing?
Students copy code into their Azure Notebook from the relevant Azure Cognitive SDK source?

**Day 2**  

**Day 3**  

**Day 4**  

## Sarah's Notes


Students are not likely to choose the spell check as their primary API, so use "Bing Spell Check API v7" as an example API to show them the format for calling the API in Python and as an example for describing the JSON output. It is OK to have students copy code into their Azure Notebook, rather than fully understand the Python HTTP requests, but they should have some instruction around what the code is doing and why.

Students can view example code (similar to what is here and simply changing their Subscription key to the one that they are assigned when they sign up for the free trial, changing the text around the code snippets to tell their particular story, and changing the input data to match ones that fit the problem they are addressing.

## Important Note

Please be sure to remind students that they shouldn't activate all of the API keys this week because they will only have 7 days. Next week they will have an opportunity to activate the ones needed for their project and in Week 4 they will be able to play with any ones they didn't use yet if they want.


Here is detail of these Week 2 course days:

## Day 1

Computer Vision and Text Analysis code walkthrough - additional examples. Or others? Students should use this as a guide to figuring out their idea, knowing that they will have to choose one or more to focus on in the next week.

Students brainstorm about cognitive and have a group discussion.

Review Project Summary with students.

## Day 2

Begin Project. Go through a sample project.

Students (potentially in groups of 2-3) work together to come up with ideas for new technology that could use these services to solve a problem.

Stop periodically to help guide students through ideation, technological design, and identifying potential issues. (Think startup pitch). Students add to their Azure Notebook with their ideas. Their goal is to identify a specific data set that they want to use to discover information using the cognitive services API.

Students develop concept
	• ideation, technological design, and identifying potential issues. (Think startup pitch
	• Encourage Team - groups of 2-3 students

## Day 3

Students develop concept
	• ideation, technological design, and identifying potential issues. 
	• Encourage Team - groups of 2-3 students

Stop periodically to help guide students through ideation, technological design, and identifying potential issues.

Review all student projects as a group.

## Day 4

Cognitive Computing code demo the API
* Demo of GitHub?
* * https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python
* Use "Bing Spell Check API v7" as an example API to show them the forma for calling the API in Python
* Demo JSON Parsing?
* Don't Start other TRIALS YET!!!

Lab: Cognitive API - Students copy code into their Azure Notebook from the the Bing Spell Check API only. Warn them not to use others due to license constraints.
