# Cognitive Hackathon: Week 2 - Teacher's Guide
## Day 2

Begin Student Project. Students work together in teams to form ideas for new technology that could use these services for socially conscious goals. Guide students through ideation, technological design, and identifying potential issues. Students add to their Azure Notebook with their ideas. They need to identify a specific data set to use with the cognitive services API.

Today we'll create teams and brainstorm their idea, from a functional standpoint. Next class will get more technical.

## HAND OUT THE STUDENT PROJECT

## Student Course Project 
Using the cognitive capabilities of computer vision and text analytics, students will create an idea of their own. They may choose whichever direction, value, industry, goal, or result that they would like to pursue. They should make it something personal to them, something that they care about or that they find interesting. Students can be an entrepreneur, be social-minded, discover something, or change the way people think. It's up to them!

## Create Teams

Create teams of two or three students to work together on the project.

## Idea Stage (15 mins)

Get started by letting everyone come up with their own idea. Students spend the next 15 minutes working *independently* to think of an idea. Once they've picked their idea, they'll answer the following questions in 2-5 sentences to share in a moment:
* What is my idea? 
* What inspired my idea?
* Who would benefit from this idea? How?

## Team Up and Choose the Big Idea (45 mins)

Students spend the next 45 minutes working with their group. Each student should present their idea individually. Afterwards, their team chooses which idea to  explore. Once they have chosen, they'll answer the following questions with their group:
* How would I build this idea? You do not have to know exactly, just an estimation of what kinds of data sources you might need and if this would be a phone app, if it needs constant Internet source, if you need access to the camera, etc).
* What are the biggest challenges? (Predict what the challenges might be to develop this product. Is it the technology? Convincing customers it's a good idea?)
* Who has done something similar? Did they succeed? How? (Spend some time searching and comparing existing products with your idea).
