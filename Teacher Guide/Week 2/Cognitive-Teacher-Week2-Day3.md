# Cognitive Hackathon: Week 2 - Teacher's Guide
## Day 3

Continue ideation phase of Student Project. Guide students as needed and encourage them to document their ideas in Notebooks. Have an Agile check-in to share and discuss team project concepts.


# Student Project

## Technology Overview (40 min)
Now that they have a high level concept for the project, let's get into the technical detail. Teams should convene and discuss technical implemention of their project. They should discuss and answer questions like these:

* What cognitive API will I use? (Explore the Azure Cognitive Services APIs and think about how you might use them)
* Where would the data come from? (A dataset doesn't have to currently exist for this project, but describe the dataset, where it would come from, and if anything similar does exist.)
* What do you think the data look like? (Give a description of what kind of data and examples of that data).
* What will be the UI design of my app? (Use Power Point, or even paper, to sketch out the screen(s) that your users would see.)
* How will I measure success? (Describe what effect you want to have with your application).


## Agile Standup (20 min)
Have the class reconvene so each team can do a Scrum-style standup report on: their idea, a brief explanation, key technical implementation considerations, and blockers.  Blockers are obstacles that they might use help with from the class. Discussion as time allows.
