# TEALS After AP Exam Cognitive Services API Lab

There are two examples using the Cognitive Services API. If you want to try them out on your own, you will have to clone the notebook so that you can run the python. 

## Cognitive Vision API
The [Cognitive Vision API](https://tealscogservexamples-sarahguthals.notebooks.azure.com/j/notebooks/cogservices_vision.ipynb) example shows how you can learn about what is in an image with this API. Specifically, something that might be difficult (e.g. identifying a person flying through the air vs diving in open sea) is correctly identified with Azure Cognitive Vision. 

## Text Analytics API
The [Text Analytics API](https://tealscogservexamples-sarahguthals.notebooks.azure.com/j/notebooks/cogservices_textanalytics.ipynb) example shows the sentiment analysis aspect of Azure Cognitive Services, showing that text excerpts can be correctly identified as positive or negative.
