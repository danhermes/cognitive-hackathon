Python supports all manners of development, including web applications, web services, desktop apps, scripting, data science, scientific computing, and Jupyter notebooks. Python is a language used by many universities, scientists, casual developers, and professional developers alike.\n\nYou can learn more about the language on [python.org](https://www.python.org/) and [Python for Beginners](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/).\n\nThis walkthrough is a Jupyter notebook version of the [python.org introductory tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/introduction.html), with some edits and amendments. Because all the code is inside code cells, you can just run each code cell inline rather than using a separate Python interactive window.\n\nThe original material in this notebook is Copyright (c) 2001-2018 Python Software Foundation.\n\n> **Note**: This notebook is designed to have you run code cells one by one, and several code cells contain deliberate errors for demonstration purposes. As a result, if you use the **Cell** > **Run All** command, some code cells past the error won't be run. To resume running the code in each case, use **Cell** > **Run All Below** from the cell after the error.\n\nThis overview covers the following topics:\n\n* Comments\n* Data Types\n* Lists\n* Control Flow Tools\n* Functions\n* Classes\n* Errors and Exceptions"

A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.\n\nSome examples:"

(More about docstrings can be found in the section Documentation Strings.) There are tools which use docstrings to automatically produce online or printed documentation, or to let the user interactively browse through code; it’s good practice to include docstrings in code that you write, so make a habit of it.\n\nThe execution of a function introduces a new symbol table used for the local variables of the function. More precisely, all variable assignments in a function store the value in the local symbol table; whereas variable references first look in the local symbol table, then in the local symbol tables of enclosing functions, then in the global symbol table, and finally in the table of built-in names. Thus, global variables cannot be directly assigned a value within a function (unless named in a global statement), although they may be referenced.\n\nThe actual parameters (arguments) to a function call are introduced in the local symbol table of the called function when it is called; thus, arguments are passed using call by value (where the value is always an object reference, not the value of the object). [1] When a function calls another function, a new local symbol table is created for that call.\n\nComing from other languages, you might object that fib is not a function but a procedure since it doesn’t return a value. In fact, even functions without a return statement do return a value, albeit a rather boring one. This value is called None (it’s a built-in name). Writing the value None is normally suppressed by the interpreter if it would be the only value written. You can see it if you really want to using print():"

Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.\n\nCompared with other programming languages, Python’s class mechanism adds classes with a minimum of new syntax and semantics. It is a mixture of the class mechanisms found in C++ and Modula-3. Python classes provide all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming: the class inheritance mechanism allows multiple base classes, a derived class can override any methods of its base class or classes, and a method can call the method of a base class with the same name. Objects can contain arbitrary amounts and kinds of data. As is true for modules, classes partake of the dynamic nature of Python: they are created at runtime, and can be modified further after creation.\n\nIn C++ terminology, normally class members (including the data members) are public (except see below Private Variables), and all member functions are virtual. As in Modula-3, there are no shorthands for referencing the object’s members from its methods: the method function is declared with an explicit first argument representing the object, which is provided implicitly by the call. As in Smalltalk, classes themselves are objects. This provides semantics for importing and renaming. Unlike C++ and Modula-3, built-in types can be used as base classes for extension by the user. Also, like in C++, most built-in operators with special syntax (arithmetic operators, subscripting etc.) can be redefined for class instances.\n\nClasses introduce a little bit of new syntax, three new object types, and some new semantics. The simplest form of class definition looks like this:"

The function definitions inside a class normally have a peculiar form of argument list, dictated by the calling conventions for methods — again, this is explained later.\n\nWhen a class definition is entered, a new namespace is created, and used as the local scope — thus, all assignments to local variables go into this new namespace. In particular, function definitions bind the name of the new function here.\n\nWhen a class definition is left normally (via the end), a class object is created. This is basically a wrapper around the contents of the namespace created by the class definition; we’ll learn more about class objects in the next section. The original local scope (the one in effect just before the class definition was entered) is reinstated, and the class object is bound here to the class name given in the class definition header (ClassName in the example)."
