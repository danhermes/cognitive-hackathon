But what does it mean?\n\n<br><br><br>\n## Artifical Intelligence (AI)\n\nSome say that cognitive computing is AI, and some say that cognitive is a kind of artificial intelligence, but most say there is a difference: cognitive computing supplements human decision-making rather than making decisions for people. For example, in an artificial intelligence system, the system would have told the doctor which course of action to take based on its analysis. In cognitive computing, the system provides information to help the doctor decide. As Rob High, IBM’s CTO for Watson put it, “What it’s really about is involvement of a human in the loop,” and he describes cognitive computing as “augmented intelligence” rather than artificial intelligence. Also, cognitive computing is made to communicate with humans in our own language (speech, conversational text, etc.).\n\n### - What's the diff between AI and Cognitive Computing?\n### - People don't agree on this, but here are some suggestions from the experts:\n#### - Cognitive computing is meant to interface with and think like humans to aid human decisions\n#### - AI is meant to solve problems and make decisions for us\n\n<br><br><br>\n![alt text](https://www.intelegain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/xDistinguishing-between-cognitive-computing-AI1-672x370.jpg.pagespeed.ic.A8EgGx6nmS.jpg \"Elephants\")\n<br><br>\n\n### Most of the world uses a looser definition, which we'll go with today: AI includes systems that are thinking for us to help us solve problems.\n### Here are some examples:\n\nHere are some examples of AI in our life today. Some are everyday uses and some are socially conscious applications.\n\n<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n## Saving Elephants\n\n\n### - Fewer than 500,000 elephants left on earth\n### - Asian elephants are endangered, with fewer than 40,000 remaining \n\n<br><br><br>\n![alt text](https://1gew6o3qn6vx9kp3s42ge0y1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/122/2018/08/WWF-C-Krista-Lyons.jpg \"Elephants\")\n<br><br>\n\n## What’s happening to them? \n\n### - Poaching is a huge problem\n### - Every year >20,000 elephants are killed\n### - illegal ivory trade\n\nMicrosoft's AI for Earth program is implementing cloud and AI tools that are leading these important efforts to create change. From using acoustic monitors to track elephants and their wellbeing, to using AI in the creation of predictive techniques that alert rangers of poaching patterns so they can mitigate issues before a crime can take place. \n\n## Solutions\n\n### - acoustic monitors to track elephants and their wellbeing\n### - AI observes and predicts poaching patterns\n### - Alerts rangers to step in BEFORE the crime happens\n<br><br><br><br><br><br>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n## Music Recommendations\n\nMusic services pay attention to the songs that you listen to and the ones that you skip. AI uses that data to make song recommendations.\n\n### - Music services look at what you listen to\n### - Recommended Songs, Albums, and Playlists\n### - Suggested New Releases, Pl\n\n<br><br><br>\n![alt text](https://spotify.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/62207iFCA28C284B277399/image-size/large?v=1.0&px=999 \"Music\")\n<br><br>\n\nGoogle Play also offers personalized music recommendations. Its AI-powered suggestions take into account factors like weather and time of day to offer music that can set the mood for activities. For example, you might be offered a playlist of dance music on a Friday night, or soft acoustic music on a rainy day.\n\n### Google Play personalizes using:\n#### - Weather\n#### - Time of day\n#### - Day of week\n#### - Your location (work/home)\n<br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n\n\n\n\n## Autonomous and Connected Electric Vehicles\nAI-guided autonomous vehicles (AVs) will enable a transition to mobility on-demand over the coming years and decades. Substantial greenhouse gas reductions for urban transport can be unlocked through route and traffic optimisation, eco-driving algorithms, programmed “platooning” of cars to traffic, and autonomous ride-sharing services. Electric AV fleets will be critical to deliver real gains.\n\n### - AI-guided autonomous vehicles (AVs)\n### - Route and traffic optimization for shorter routes (\"platooning\")\n### - Shorter routes means less driving\n### - Less driving means less greenhouse gas emissions\n\n<br><br>\n![alt text](https://media2.govtech.com/images/940*562/Connected+Autonomous+Vehicles.jpg \"AVs\")\n\n<br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n\n\n\n## Google Predictive Searches\n\nWhen you begin typing a search term and Google makes recommendations for you to choose from, that’s AI in action.\n\n### - When you start to type something in Google\n### - Google finishes your thought for you\n### - Those string suggestions come from AI\n\n<br><br><br>\n![alt text](https://redjamal.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/4535133806_21780d9aa4.jpg \"Google\")\n<br><br>\n\nPredictive searches are based on data that Google collects about you, such as your location, age, and other personal details. Using AI, the search engine attempts to guess what you might be trying to find.\n<br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n\n\n\n\n## Chatbots\n\nChatbots recognize words and phrases in order to (hopefully) deliver helpful content to customers who have common questions. Chatbots attempt to mimic natural language, simulating conversations as they help with routine tasks such as booking appointments, taking orders, or answering billing questions. Sometimes, chatbots are so accurate that it seems as if you’re talking to a real person.\n\n### - Ever chatted with a company online? That was probably a chatbot.\n### - Chatbots are trained with common questions to answer (FAQs)\n### - They are given a flow for each conversation (skill)\n### - All to try and help you (or sell you something)\n\nA recent survey jointly conducted by BBC Earth and Berkeley University, revealed that watching nature documentaries can trigger happiness. That was a real “aha!” moment for BBC Earth, and one that fuelled the launch of the Real Happiness project. Real Happiness is simple – users interact with a Messenger chatbot, which then sends them personalized animal videos. It’s purpose is to bring people and nature closer together.\n\n<br><br>\n![alt text](http://www.hotsaucedrops.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bbc1.jpg \"Chatbot\")\n\n<br><br><br>\n![alt text](http://www.hotsaucedrops.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bbc4-577x1024.jpg \"Chatbot\")\n<br><br><br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br>\n\n\n## Smart Agriculture\n\nAI-augmented agriculture involves automated data collection, decision-making and corrective actions via robotics to allow early detection of crop diseases and issues, to provide timed nutrition to livestock, and generally optimise agricultural inputs and returns based on supply and demand. \n\n### - Automated data collection and decision-making\n### - Detect crop disease and other problems\n### - Timed nutrition to livestock\n\n<br><br><br>\n![alt text](http://www.netralnews.com/foto/2018/09/19/428-ilustrasi_smart_farming_40-696x341.jpg \"Smart Agriculture\")\n\n<br><br>\nThis promises to increase the resource efficiency of the agriculture industry, lowering the use of water, fertilisers and pesticides which cause damage to important ecosystems, and increase resilience to climate extremes.\n\n### - Save water\n### - Use fewer pesticides and fertilizers\n### - Protect farms against climate extremes\n<br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n\n\n\n\n## Product Recommendations\n\nAmazon and other online retailers use AI to gather information about your preferences and buying habits. Then, they personalize your shopping experience by suggesting new products tailored to your habits.\n\n### - Amazon and other online retailers gather data \n### - On your preferences and buying habits\n### - AI uses this data to build a profile\n### - AI intelligently recommends new products\n\nBelow is an example of AI-powered recommendations on Amazon.com.\n\n<br><br><br>\n![alt text](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-27-at-15.07.36.png \"Product Recommendations\")\n\n<br><br>\nWhen you search for an item such as “Bose headsets,” the search engine also shows related items that other people have purchased when searching for the same product.\n<br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n\n\n## Maps and Directions\n\nWhen apps like Google Maps calculate traffic and construction in order to find the quickest route to your destination, that’s AI at work.\n\n### - Google Maps gathers data on\n#### - Traffic patterns\n#### - Your past destinations\n#### - Your home location\n#### - Your work location\n#### - Accidents\n### - Google's AI optimizes your route\n\nIn the example below, Google Maps offers directions based on the fastest route according to the usual traffic.\n\n<br><br><br>\n![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*Ie1ay0LFB5qrwz0s.png \"Maps and Directions\")\n<br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n\n\n## Smart Disaster Response\nAI can analyse simulations and real-time data (including social media data) of weather events and disasters in a region to seek out vulnerabilities and enhance disaster preparation, provide early warning, and prioritise response through coordination of emergency information capabilities. Deep reinforcement learning may one day be integrated into disaster simulations to determine optimal response strategies.\n\n### - AIs gather data on weather and past disasters\n### - Seeks to identify vulnerabilities\n### - Provide early warning\n<br><br><br>\n![alt text](https://newsroom.cisco.com/documents/10157/14740/drones-disaster-rt-feature_1200x675_hero_082718.jpg/957a7d8c-d15d-46c7-ae8f-ec7a150dd474?t=1535403257558 \"Smart Disaster Response\")\n<br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n\n\n## Ride-sharing Apps\n\nRide-sharing service Uber uses AI to determine how long it will take to get from your location to your destination. This lets you know when to expect a driver or food delivery.\n\nIn May 2017, ZDNet tech news website published a report that revealed how Uber uses artificial intelligence to set prices based on what they think you might be willing to pay.\n\n### Uber uses AI to predict many things:\n#### - Length of your trip\n#### - Wait time for a driver\n#### - Price of your trip\n\n<br><br><br>\n![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*SikeFJ58Woe-Oya6.png \"Ride-sharing Apps\")\n<br><br>\n\nA recent report by The Independent claims that Uber is developing artificial intelligence that will help determine if a rider has been drinking — before the driver agrees to pick up the passenger. This AI-powered software would attempt to determine a rider’s state by analyzing and comparing patterns of typing, walking speed, and other factors.\n<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n  \n  \n  \n## Helping the Earth\n\n### AI is already helping the earth.\n### Here are some areas of focus:\n\n<br><br><br>\n![alt text](https://github.com/danhermes/cognitive-hackathon/blob/master/images/Week%201/Areas-of-focus.gif?raw=true \"Focus\")\n<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n\n## Timeline for Earth-friendly AI advances\n\n<br><br><br>\n![alt text](https://pwc.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451623c69e20223c849dd65200c-pi \"Focus\")\n<br><br>\nSource: PwC\n"
