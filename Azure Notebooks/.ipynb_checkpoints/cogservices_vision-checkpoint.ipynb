This proof of concept will be focused on detecting corals, scuba diving equipment, and other reef-related images. We will also explore a similar example of skydiving, perhaps challenging to the service since the colors and gear visually is similar to scuba diving, and both the sky and sea are blue. These service calls return JSON contains tags with the services guesses which are each accompanied by a confidence level.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Remember to enter your *API key* (secret) and *uri_base* that correspond to your own cognitive service license in the code below so your service calls will succeed.\n\n### - Computer Vision cognitive service\n### - Detect objects and activity in underwater setting\n### - Calls are assigned Tags and Confidences\n<br><br><br>\n\n## First Image: Coral Reef \n\nOur first image is obviously a photo of a coral reef with wildlife and fish.\n\n<br><br>\n![](https://timeincsecure-a.akamaihd.net/rtmp_uds/293884104/201703/2681/293884104_5360456295001_5360434467001-vs.jpg?pubId=293884104&videoId=5360434467001)\n"
