## Microsoft TEALS Cognitive Hackathon Course

This is a four week course designed to engage students with cognitive computing. A course project will serve as the centerpiece of the course, and students will learn about cognitive computing using real-world examples, in-class demos, and hands-on labs.

## Files and Folders 
The Course Overview is in the top level folder.
The Student Project is contained in the root level */Student Materials* folder.

There are three main folders:

### /Azure Notebooks
This folder contains Azure notebooks for use by both the students and teacher.


### /Student Materials
This folder contains materials for students broken out by week (1-4). The Student Project is contained in the root level folder.

This folder contains all teacher materials including week intros containing overviews for the week, guide sheets for every day in the course, and a rubric to assist in scoring the students.

## Topics
Here are the topics by week:

**Week 1**  Introduce cognitive computing and the development environment

**Week 2**  Students brainstorm their project concept 

**Week 3**  Students implement their project concept 

**Week 4**  Project Conclusions, Discussion, and Data Presentation

Here is detail of the four course weeks:

### Week 1
Introduce cognitive computing and the development environment for the course. Azure Notebooks will be presented and worked with in a hands-on lab. Python fundamentals will be presented as well, along with a lab. Real-world Artificial Intelligence (AI) examples will be presented.

### Week 2
Firsthand cognitive examples will be presented. The course project begins: Students will brainstorm their project concept and choose an idea. They will group into teams to choose specific ideas to develop. Requirements, applications, and technical considerations will be discussed. Live Python code example of spell check cognitive service will be presented.

### Week 3
Teacher demonstrates Cognitive API code examples to prepare students for Computer Vision and Text Analytics Labs. Students will implement their cognitive concept in the course project and form conclusions.

### Week 4
Students will present their Project Conclusions. They will discuss considerations with data and apply these to their project. Additional cognitive services may be experimented with.
