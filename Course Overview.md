Introduce cognitive computing and the development environment for the course. Azure Notebooks will be presented and worked with in a hands-on lab. Python fundamentals will be presented as well, along with a lab. Real-world Artificial Intelligence (AI) examples will be presented.

## Week 2
Firsthand cognitive examples will be presented. The course project begins: Students will brainstorm their project concept and choose an idea. They will group into teams to choose specific ideas to develop. Requirements, applications, and technical considerations will be discussed.
